# Sustainable shopping / Wear to find

This project was made for Thrivent's 2025 innovation week. This frontend / db was made by Peter Olsen (2025 summer intern),
and is probably not the best indication of my work as a developer. There's a LOT of AI written code in here, but it was necessary to ship out such a project in such a quick amount of time.
